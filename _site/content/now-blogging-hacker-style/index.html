	<p>So there I was &#8211; nine shades of eager to make content for this here blog, but of course life had something else to say. As all of you are probably aware of, it&#8217;s hard work to keep up a blog and it is always easier to say you will start doing something than it actually is doing said thing.</p>

<p>Recently I decided that I wanted to move away from WordPress and in to something that suited my style more. This is when I realized that GitHub pages, which take use of Jekyll, work pretty flawlessly as a place to host apps similar to this blog. The workflow that comes from working with Jekyll and GitHub made sense to me so I set out to create a site from the ground up to host the blog.</p>

<p>The result is what you see infront of you now.</p>

<p>I learned a ton about Jekyll and have started to come up with a workflow including drafts and published blog posts, which I will be attempting to share with everyone in an upcoming blog post series.</p>

<p>That being said, it&#8217;s good to be back! Famous last words, I know, but here&#8217;s to something more regular!</p>
