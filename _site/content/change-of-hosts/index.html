		<h1>Change of Hosts</h1>
	</header>
	<p>Originally I attempted to host this blog over at <a href='https://www.appfog.com/'>AppFog</a> &#8211; a neat PaaS company that theoretically could allow me to host this blog for free. However, there were a few issues that I could just not get down to the root of, so I decided to give a &#8220;regular&#8221; host a shot for now while I try to figure out exactly what was going on.</p>

<p>For those of you interested, a few of the issues were:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>No FTP Access &#8211; This actually meant that not all files were permanently saved, and whenever the app needed to restart I would have to re&#8211;apply these changes. This meant I had to update my WordPress install every time I restarted, or I would have to re&#8211;upload media library files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Random Restarts &#8211; For some reason over the last few days I found that my WordPress instance had randomly restarted &#8211;forcing me to go through the pains of the bullet point above.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>DNS Issues &#8211; Oddly enough pointing my DNS server for carlbergenhem.com to the application would only work once in a while. I would often check back and see that carlbergenhem.com couldn&#8217;t be resolved. This was a big one for me.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong though, <a href='https://www.appfog.com/'>AppFog</a> is a pretty fantastic when it comes to hosting applications. The fact that we can throw up something on there for free and having as many applications as you&#8217;d like share the two GB of free memory is also a huge plus. WordPress (what I use for this blog) just might not be the best kind of application for it (yet).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll still keep on using their services for my other apps though!</p>
