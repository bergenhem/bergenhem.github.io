title: Now Blogging Hacker Style

So there I was -- nine shades of eager to make content for this here blog, but of course life had something else to say. As all of you are probably aware of, it's hard work to keep up a blog and it is always easier to say you will start doing something than it actually is doing said thing.

Recently I decided that I wanted to move away from WordPress and in to something that suited my style more. This is when I realized that GitHub pages, which take use of Jekyll, work pretty flawlessly as a place to host apps similar to this blog. The workflow that comes from working with Jekyll and GitHub made sense to me so I set out to create a site from the ground up to host the blog.

The result is what you see infront of you now.

I learned a ton about Jekyll and have started to come up with a workflow including drafts and published blog posts, which I will be attempting to share with everyone in an upcoming blog post series.

That being said, it's good to be back! Famous last words, I know, but here's to something more regular!
