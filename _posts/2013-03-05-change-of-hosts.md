title: Change of Hosts
---
Originally I attempted to host this blog over at [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/) -- a neat PaaS company that theoretically could allow me to host this blog for free. However, there were a few issues that I could just not get down to the root of, so I decided to give a "regular" host a shot for now while I try to figure out exactly what was going on.

For those of you interested, a few of the issues were:

* No FTP Access -- This actually meant that not all files were permanently saved, and whenever the app needed to restart I would have to re--apply these changes. This meant I had to update my WordPress install every time I restarted, or I would have to re--upload media library files.

* Random Restarts -- For some reason over the last few days I found that my WordPress instance had randomly restarted --forcing me to go through the pains of the bullet point above.

* DNS Issues -- Oddly enough pointing my DNS server for carlbergenhem.com to the application would only work once in a while. I would often check back and see that carlbergenhem.com couldn't be resolved. This was a big one for me.

Don't get me wrong though, [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/) is a pretty fantastic when it comes to hosting applications. The fact that we can throw up something on there for free and having as many applications as you'd like share the two GB of free memory is also a huge plus. WordPress (what I use for this blog) just might not be the best kind of application for it (yet).

I'll still keep on using their services for my other apps though!
